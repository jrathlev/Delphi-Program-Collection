## F-Plot - Version 4.1

### Utility to calculate and display frequency responses of linear networks   

The program can be used to calculate the frequency responses of filter circuits designed as linear networks in the form of a two-port with common reference point. The circuit may contain resistors, capacitors, inductors, and operational amplifiers. The result can be displayed either as a Bode plot or Nyquist plot. 

The frequency and amplitude axes can be set to a linear or logarithmic scale. 
By default, the amplitude, phase, and real and imaginary parts are scaled 
automatically for a preselected frequency range.

The circuit input is made in the form of a component table with assigned circuit 
nodes. In the graph the frequency responses of up to four freely selectable output 
nodes can be displayed. In addition, it is possible to include several different 
values (one main value and up to 20 secondary values) for one component in order 
to assess its influence on the frequency response.
