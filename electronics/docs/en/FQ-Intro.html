<h3><a name="Start">Overview</a></h3>
<p>The program can be used to calculate the frequency responses of filter circuits 
  designed as linear networks in the form of a two-port with common reference point. 
  The circuit may contain resistors, capacitors, inductors, and operational amplifiers. 
  The result can be displayed graphically as either as a 
  <a href="fq-sample.html#diagramm1">Bode plot</a> or 
  <a href="FQ-Sample.html#ortskurve1">Nyquist plot</a>.
</p>
<p>The frequency and amplitude axes can be set to a linear or logarithmic scale. By default, 
  the amplitude, phase, and real and imaginary parts are scaled automatically for a 
  preselected frequency range.</p>
<p>The circuit input is made in the form of a component table with assigned circuit nodes. 
  In the graph the frequency responses of up to four freely selectable output nodes can be displayed. 
  In addition, it is possible to include several different values (one main value and up 
  to 20 secondary values) for one component in order to assess its influence on the 
  frequency response.</p>

<h3><a name="Install"></a>Installation</h3>
<p>The program is provided in a <i>zip</i> archive and can be unzipped into any 
  directory (e.g., <i>C:\MyProgram\Circuits</i>). It consists only of an <i>EXE</i> file 
  representing the executable program and detailed instructions with illustrations and examples. 
  To uninstall, simply delete this directory and its files.</p> 
  
<h3>Starting the program</h3>
<p> A shortcut in the Start menu or on the Desktop must be created manually. 
  The program can also be started by double-clicking <i>FPlot.exe</i> in the Windows Explorer.</p>
