## SVG Explorer 2.0

### Utility to explore SVG Icons on disk

The program is based on the SVGExplorer by 
[Ethea](https://www.ethea.it/docs/SVGIconImageList)
, a demo program from the [SVGIconImageList](https://github.com/EtheaDev/SVGIconImageList) package. The following changes and extensions have been implemented:
- **ShellTreeView** component used for directory selection
- **Improved preview** by replacing the *TIconImage* component with *TPaintBox* for better rendering
- **Image properties** are displayed for the selected image
- **PNG export** in selectable size using the functions of *SVGIconUtils*
- **SVG optimizing** by calling the external program [SvgCleaner](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/svgcleaner) to losslessly reduce the sizes of SVG images
