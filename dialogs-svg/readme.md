## Delphi dialogs with SVG graphics

This repository contains a collection of several **dialogs** using components from the [SVGIconImageList](https://github.com/EtheaDev/SVGIconImageList) program package provided by [Ethea](https://www.ethea.it/docs/SVGIconImageList/). 

For older Delphi versions the [JR-Buttons](../components) package is required to support SVG glyphs with buttons.

The multiple languages support uses the [GnuGettext for Delpi](https://github.com/jrathlev/GnuGetText-for-Delphi) package. The translations for several languages are included.
